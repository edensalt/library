# Project: Library ðŸš§ Currently under construction ðŸš§

Example library for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library">Odin Project: JavaScript course</a>

## Skills demonstrated

- Objects and object constructors
- DOM manipulation and JS event listeners
- JS arrays (sorting, calculations) and for loops
- Forms
- CSS grid

## Updates 
- Clear form when submitted
- Add option to change read to yes or no
- Update read filter to read, not read, or all
- SORT BY PAGES IS WORKING FOR NEW BOOKS, BUT SORT BY TITLE ISN'T. That's because it's case sensitive. Need to get to all lowercase first
