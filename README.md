# Project: Library ðŸš§ Currently under construction ðŸš§

Example library for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library">Odin Project: JavaScript course</a>

## Skills demonstrated

- Objects and object constructors
- DOM manipulation and JS event listeners
- JS arrays (sorting) and for loops
- Forms
- CSS grid

## Updates 
- Need to actually update the library data when a book is removed, not just visually remove it from the dom. I know this isn't working because when I filter the books, the removed ones come back.
